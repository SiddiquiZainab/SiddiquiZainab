## Projects

### [Song Lyrics Generation Model](https://github.com/SiddiquiZainab/Song-Lyrics-Generation-Model)
A machine learning model for generating song lyrics using advanced neural network techniques. This model leverages Bi-directional LSTM to create coherent and creative lyrics in various styles.

### [Fruit Classification Using Transfer Learning](https://github.com/SiddiquiZainab/FruitC)
A deep learning model for accurate classification  of 10 fruit categories. The objective is to build a model that can accurately identify the type of fruit based on images.

### [Student Concentration Detection](https://github.com/SiddiquiZainab/Student_Concentration_Detection)
A computer vision project for detecting student concentration levels using image classification techniques. The concentration levels can be broadly one of these two: engaged and not engaged, which have 3 sub-categories each. So, the model predicts one level out of 6.

### [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/SiddiquiZainab/Heart-Disease-Prediction)
A project about predicting heart disease using machine learning models and ensemble methods. It is a classification of a patient based on clinical parameters into healthy and not healthy in terms of heart. Evaluations are done using the Cleveland dataset.

### [Streamlit Web Application For Analyzing Sentiment](https://github.com/SiddiquiZainab/Sentiment)
A web application for sentiment analysis built using Streamlit. The application analyzes digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral.
